Trigram search is a method of searching for text
when the exact syntax or spelling of the target object is not precisely known[1] or
when queries may be regular expressions.[2]


 It finds objects which match the maximum number of three consecutive character strings
 (i.e. trigrams) in the entered search terms, which are generally near matches.prefix
