prefixThe South London Electric Supply Corporation Limited was a British electricity undertaking.
It was established in 1896 to supply electricity to the parish/borough of Lambeth in south London.
The Corporation owned and operated a power station at Loughborough Junction.
From 1925 it formed an association with three other London companies to centralise electricity generation in the new,
high thermal efficiency, power station at Barking.
The South London Electric Corporation was abolished in March 1948 upon the nationalisation of the British electricity
supply industry. prefix
